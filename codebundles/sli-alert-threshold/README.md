# SLI Alert Threshold
This codebundle allows you to monitor another SLI and trigger a TaskSet when the expected rate of a SLI value falls below a specified threshold.

## SLI
Depending on your observability needs, the Multi-Window Multi-Burn algorithm + SLO error budgets approach may not apply to your use case. In those cases you can use this codebundle to create an alert threshold based on another SLI. A query will be performed on the monitored SLI's metrics for a given time window and resolution, and then the presence of a success (threshold) value will be checked. For example: fetch 1 hour of metric data at 5 minute intervals, for the monitored SLI; a `0` means failure and `1` means healthy. If we set the success value to `1` and a rate of `1.0` (100%) then when any failure occurs in the monitored SLI, this codebundle will immediately alert and trigger the given TaskSet.

### Use Case: SLI: Trigger a slack message when my API health check fails
For our public API, it's uptime is critical, so we can monitor its health check and send a slack message to a team channel whenever the health check fails.

```
> Because the window in this example is `1h` and our threshold rate is `100%` then if 1 error is detected in the metric data, the threshold will be alerting for the next `1h` while it persists in the window. Consider this when determining your window, resolution and expected threshold rate in relation to how you want the TaskSet to behave.

## Requirements
- The name of the SLI you want to monitor
- Verify that the SLI submits a consistent value that denotes a success (eg: 0 is always good, 1 is always good, etc) as you'll need to set this as your `threshold value`
- The name of the workspace the SLX, SLI and TaskSet reside in

## TODO
- [ ] Add additional notes for tweaking threshold models to get the desired behaviour
- [ ] Add docs for connecting to another workspace
